# JetBrainsNRK

This is a modified version of [JetBrains Mono v2.001](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono).
The reason for choosing `v2.001` is because of [this issue](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/issues/334).

Some notable changes are:

* Patched with [Nerd-Font-Patcher](https://github.com/N-R-K/nerd-font-patcher)
* Smaller case `u` has been replaced with `u` from DejaVu Sans Mono.
* All non-alphanumeric ascii chars have medium thickness.
* Additional `Condensed` (-6%) version for better utilizing horizontal screen space.
* Additional glyphs from 2.242 merged in (might cause some issues).
