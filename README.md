# NRK Mono

This is a modified version of [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono)
based on `v2.001`. The reason for choosing `v2.001` is due to the
[line height issue](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/issues/334)
on later versions.

Some notable changes are:

* Patched with [Nerd-Font-Patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest) (search for `FontPatcher`).
* Slashed zero instead of dotted one. *(Screenshots below not updated yet)*
* Smaller case `u` has been replaced with `u` from DejaVu Sans Mono.
* All non-alphanumeric ascii chars have medium thickness.
* Additional `Condensed` (-6%) version for better utilizing horizontal screen space.
* Additional glyphs from `v2.242` merged in (might cause some issues).
